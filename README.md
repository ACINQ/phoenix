Phoenix is a Bitcoin wallet developed by [ACINQ](https://acinq.co), that allows you to send and receive bitcoins securely over the Lightning Network. It is self-custodial, which means that **you hold the keys** of the wallet. It provides a simple and clean UX. Thanks to native Lightning support, payments are faster and cheaper.

---

:rotating_light: This wallet is self-custodial. It means that, when creating a new wallet, a 12-words recovery phrase is generated. Only you have it. It is your responsibility to make a backup of that recovery phrase. It gives full access to your funds, so do not share it with anyone. If you lose the recovery phrase, your funds are lost.

## Download

Phoenix is available for Android and iOS:
- for iOS: [on the App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/phoenix-wallet/id1544097028) - requires iOS 14+.
- for Android: [on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fr.acinq.phoenix.mainnet), or [get the APK from the releases](https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix/releases) - requires Android 8+.

## Build and test Phoenix

Phoenix is separated in 3 modules:
- `phoenix-shared`: business logic written in Kotlin, shared between the iOS and the Android applications. Uses [lightning-kmp](https://github.com/ACINQ/lightning-kmp) for everything Lightning/Bitcoin related.
- `phoenix-android`: the UI for the new Android application, written in Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Instructions to build this app are provided [here](https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix/blob/master/phoenix-android/BUILD.md).
- `phoenix-ios`: the UI for the iOS application, written in Swift. Instructions to build this app are provided [here](https://github.com/ACINQ/phoenix/blob/master/BUILD.md).

About about the legacy Android app:
`phoenix-legacy` contains the old, legacy Android application (version 1.x), using [eclair-core](https://github.com/ACINQ/eclair) for Lightning. This application has been replaced by `phoenix-android`. However, this legacy app is still embedded in the new production application for migration purposes. It will be removed eventually.
