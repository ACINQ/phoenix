Phoenix is a Bitcoin wallet. It allows you to send and receive bitcoins securely. It is non custodial and provides a simple and clean UX. Thanks to native Lightning support, payments are faster and cheaper.

It is developed by [ACINQ](https://acinq.co), one of the leading companies working on Bitcoin scalability.
