      When you receive a payment on L1, Phoenix will automatically move the funds to L2 <b>IF</b> the miner fees adhere to your configured fee policy.

      Payments you receive on L2 can be received instantly and for zero fees. However, occasionally an L1 operation is also required in order to manage the L2 payment channel. This can be done automatically <b>IF</b> the miner fees adhere to your configured fee policy.
