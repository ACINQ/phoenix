<p>
	Phoenix allows you to receive payments on bitcoin's blockchain
	layer (L1) and bitcoin's lightning layer (L2).
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		The blockchain layer (L1) is slower,
		and generally much more expenisve (requires miner fees)
	</li>
	<li>
		The lightning layer (L2) is much faster,
		and generally much cheaper (especially for smaller payments)
	</li>
</ul>
<p>
	When you receive a payment on L1, Phoenix will automatically
	move the funds to L2 <b>if</b> the miner fees adhere to your
	configured fee policy.
</p>
<p>
	Most payments you receive on L2 are received instantly and for
	zero fees. However, occassionally an L1 operation is also
	required in order to manage the L2 payment channel. This can
	be done automatically <b>if</b> the miner fees adhere to your
	configured fee policy.
