/**
 * This class exposes a channel's more important information in an easy-to-consume format.
 *
 * @param channelId the channel's identifier as a hexadecimal string.
 * @param state the channel's state that may contain commitments information.
 * @param isBooting if true, this data comes from the local database and the channel has not yet been reestablished
 *      with the peer. As such, the data may be obsolete (for example, if the peer actually force-closed the channel
 *      while Phoenix was disconnected). If false, this data is the live view of the channel as negotiated with the
 *      peer and can be considered up-to-date (but there's no guarantee, as the channel may actually be disconnected!).
